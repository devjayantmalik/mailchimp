# Why I cloned it?
Dear visitors, I created this project to improve my coding skills. I do not want to harm any organisation or do not claim any product or resource to be mine. All the resources belong to their product owners. I created this project to learn and test my bootstrap and html skills.

# Contributions
You can add or remove any code from the project as per your choice. Feel free to clone the repository. It will be better for beginners to visit [mailchimp.com](https://mailchimp.com) and try to implement the design of the website as per your skills. This will definitely be a good project for you.
